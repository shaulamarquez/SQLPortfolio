# Global COVID-19 Impact Analysis: Deaths and Vaccination Trends

Welcome to my SQL portfolio dedicated to the analysis of global COVID-19 data, specifically focusing on deaths and vaccination trends. In this repository, I leverage SQL queries to dive into the intricate details of the pandemic's impact worldwide, exploring patterns, correlations, and insights that can be derived from the available data.

## Objectives

1. **Understanding Mortality Rates:** Analyzing the distribution of COVID-19-related deaths across countries and regions, identifying hotspots and assessing the overall impact.

2. **Vaccination Coverage Assessment:** Examining the progress of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns globally, including vaccination rates, coverage by country, and the correlation with changes in mortality rates.

3. **Temporal Analysis:** Investigating how the trends in deaths and vaccination rates have evolved over time, identifying critical periods and assessing the effectiveness of vaccination efforts.

## Projects

### 1. Global Mortality Analysis

- **Description:** A detailed examination of COVID-19-related deaths worldwide. This project involves querying and aggregating mortality data to identify regions with higher mortality rates and understand the factors contributing to these patterns.

- **Skills Demonstrated:**
  - Advanced SQL aggregations
  - Comparative analysis of mortality rates
  - Data visualization queries

### 2. Vaccination Progress Dashboard

- **Description:** Creating a dynamic dashboard that visualizes the progress of COVID-19 vaccination efforts globally. This project includes SQL queries to extract and transform vaccination data for use in visualization tools.

- **Skills Demonstrated:**
  - Data transformation queries
  - Creating SQL views for visualization
  - Integration with external reporting tools
